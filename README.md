# Determination Test

Implementation of a **psychodiagnostic determination test** designed to evaluate a user's **reactive stress tolerance**.  
The application is intended to mimic the functionality and behavior of the **SCHUHFRIED Determination Test (DT)**.

Developed as a part of bachelor thesis at the **Czech Technical University in Prague – Faculty of Mechanical Engineering**.

## About this project - author's note
This project was my first large-scale programming effort, completed while learning Python from scratch.  
It reflects my ability to quickly acquire new technical skills and apply them to build a fully functional software system.

## Overview

The Determination Test measures how quickly and accurately a participant can respond to rapidly changing visual stimuli under time pressure. It is commonly used in psychological and cognitive assessments to evaluate:

- Reactive stress tolerance  
- Attention and concentration  
- Processing speed  
- Sensorimotor coordination  

The software is combined with a custom made hardware in the for of a control panel. The control panel is operated by RaspberryPI and consists of arcade buttons and pedals.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- PyGame

**Frontend**
- Kivy

**Database**
- SQLite3

## Intended Use

This software is primarily intended for:

- Research projects  
- Academic experiments  
- Educational purposes  
- Human factors studies  

It is **not certified medical software** and should not be used as a standalone diagnostic tool in clinical settings without proper validation.
